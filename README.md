The application was made for research and demonstration purposes, but you can use it freely for other purposes. The application calculates BNDVI and GNDVI vegetation indexes. If you want to change the application (for example color palette values, add the new vegetation index and other improvements), please send me the message in inbox and I will share with you the complete source code for free.
